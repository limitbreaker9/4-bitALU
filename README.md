# Logisim Projects

This repository contains my collection of digital logic design projects created in **Logisim Evolution**.  
Each project demonstrates important concepts in digital electronics such as arithmetic operations, sequential circuits, and pattern generation.

## ðŸ”¹ Projects

### 1. [ALU](./ALU)
- 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)  
- Supports:
  - Addition & Subtraction
  - AND, OR, XOR logic operations
  - Carry & Zero flags
- Cascaded to form an **8-bit ALU**  
- Includes truth tables and design files  

---

### 2. [Universal Register](./Universal_Register)
- **Universal Shift Register** supporting:
  - Parallel Load
  - Shift Left
  - Shift Right
  - Hold  
- Useful in **data transfer & temporary storage** applications  

---

### 3. [Counter with Custom Pattern](./Counter)
- Counter designed to follow a **specific sequence** rather than natural binary order  
- Implemented using Flip-Flops and combinational logic  
- Demonstrates **state machine design** and custom sequence generation  

---

### 4. [4-bit Array Multiplier](./Array_Multiplier)
- Implements a **parallel multiplication technique**  
- Generates all partial products simultaneously and sums them using adders  
- Provides fast multiplication but requires more hardware resources  
- Demonstrates the concept of **combinational multipliers**  

---

### 5. [4-bit Add-Shift Multiplier](./Add_Shift_Multiplier)
- Implements a **sequential multiplication technique**  
- Uses shift-and-add logic with registers and control signals  
- Takes multiple clock cycles but requires fewer resources  
- Demonstrates the concept of **serial multipliers**
