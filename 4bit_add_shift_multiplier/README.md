# 4-bit Add-Shift Multiplier

This project implements a **sequential multiplier** (shift-and-add multiplier) in Logisim Evolution.

## Features
- Uses registers and control logic
- Requires multiple clock cycles to complete multiplication
- More hardware-efficient compared to the array multiplier
- Demonstrates the concept of **serial multiplication**

## Additional Notes
- A **control unit truth table** is provided (`control logic table.xlsx`) to explain the working of the circuit and control signals.
