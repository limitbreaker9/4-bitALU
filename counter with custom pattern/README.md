# Custom Sequence Counter (Logisim)

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project implements a **custom counter** in Logisim that does not follow the normal binary up/down counting.  
Instead, it follows a **user-defined sequence of states** using Flip-Flops and combinational logic.

## ðŸ”¹ Sequence Implemented
The counter progresses through the following 16 states:
15 â†’ 14 â†’ 11 â†’ 3 â†’ 5 â†’ 12 â†’ 13 â†’ 6 â†’ 10 â†’ 1 â†’ 4 â†’ 9 â†’ 7 â†’ 8 â†’ 2 â†’ 0 â†’ (repeat)

- Total **16 unique states** (covers all possible 4-bit combinations)  
- Implements **nonlinear state transitions**  
- Returns to `15` after reaching `0`

## ðŸ”¹ Design Details
- Built using **D Flip-Flops** for state storage  
- **Next state logic** derived using K-Maps and Boolean minimization  
- Demonstrates the concept of **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**  
- Clock-driven, fully synchronous design  

## ðŸ”¹ Applications
- Learning tool for understanding **state machine design**  
- Demonstrates **sequence generation** beyond natural binary counting  
- Can be extended for **pseudo-random number generation** or specific control sequences
